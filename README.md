From the Horiseon starter code, I was able to refactor the html and css code to follow
semantic structure. Within the css stylesheet I also consolidated all of the rules for it 
to not be rundundant and added comments for each of the sections. All links are functional 
images have descriptive alt tags. 


![alt text](assets/images/Horiseon1.jpg) "Header and hero")
![alt text](assets/images/Horiseon2.jpg) "Content")
![alt text](assets/images/Horiseon3.jpg) "Footer")
